    ">One of the most popular types of neural networks for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, is the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">LSTMs are specifically designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem, which is the difficulty for an RNN in learning to connect past information to the present task, such as using past parts of a sequence to predict future parts. This makes them ideal for tasks involving sequential data, like text, where the order and context of words is important for understanding their meaning.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">An LSTM network can take the sequence of words in a review and learn to predict the sentiment based on the learned contextual meaning of the words. It does this by maintaining a 'cell state', or a kind of working memory, that it can add or remove information to over time. This allows it to keep or discard information over long sequences, making it very effective for this kind of task.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">An LSTM network can be trained on a dataset of Amazon reviews and their associated sentiments to produce useful predictions for the sentiment of new reviews. The model would take as input a sequence of words in a review and output a prediction for the sentiment of that review.\n",

An embedding length ranging between 100 and 300 dimensions is a common choice in numerous natural language processing tasks. Regarded as a hyperparameter of the model, the embedding length can be adjusted to achieve optimal performance. Given the intricacy of our text, a dimension of 200 emerges as a favored balance, harmonizing the complexity of the text with the computational resources we have allocated.\n",

One approach to determining this parameter is by examining the distribution of sequence lengths within the data. Inferences drawn from the summary statistics and the histogram plot reveal that 95% of all reviews possess a sequence length of 55 tokens. Thus, we plan to utilize 55 as the maximum sequence length, an approach that allows us to encapsulate most of the data without inducing overfitting to the model.\n",

    ">Tokenization is the technique of dividing text into pieces, commonly known as tokens. These tokens could range from sentences and words to subwords or even individual characters.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The principal objectives we aim to achieve with tokenization include:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Disassembling text into tokens, which subsequently become the fundamental units of text that the machine learning model can comprehend and learn from.\n",
    ">- Removing punctuation and unnecessary or special characters that do not offer beneficial information for our model. The keras Tokenization function is specifically tailored to manage this process seamlessly.\n",
    ">- Transforming words to lowercase to ensure that identical words in different cases are recognized as the same. The keras Tokenization function effortlessly facilitates this process.\n",
    ">- Removing HTML tags or other unique substrings that may be present due to web scraping. Again, the keras Tokenization function proves to be proficient at handling this task.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Normalization forms an additional process with the ultimate aim of converting the text into a standardized or regular format. This reduction of data complexity allows the machine learning model to more effectively learn from it.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Our key objectives for normalization include:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Implementing lemmatization, a process that reduces inflected or occasionally derived words to their root or stem form. For example, \"runs\", \"running\", \"ran\" are all different forms of the word \"run\".\n",
    ">- Removing stop words such as \"is\", \"the\", and \"in\", which typically lack substantial meaningful information.\"\n",

    "### B3. Sequence Padding<a id='b3'/>\n",
    "---\n",
    ">Padding is an indispensable preprocessing stage that ensures all sequences, or lists of tokens, within a dataset maintain a uniform length. This uniformity is a prerequisite as most machine learning models mandate their input to have a consistent shape. If sequences fall short of a certain length, padding steps in to fill the remaining spaces with 0, whereas sequences exceeding the length are generally truncated to match it.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- We first decide on a sequence length. Choosing the sequence length often involves a trade-off: if it's too short, we might lose useful information; if it's too long, we might introduce too much noise from the extra padding.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- We then use the Keras pad_sequences function to apply padding to the sequences. The function takes a list of sequences (list of lists) and transforms them all into sequences of the same length.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The decision between pre-padding and post-padding holds significant relevance when working with LSTM networks. Given their gating mechanisms, these networks may potentially \"forget\" information from earlier in the sequence. Consequently, it's generally more effective to pad at the sequence's beginning (pre-padding), as the network might not pay much attention to padding tokens.\n",

    ">Our embedding layer functions as a look-up table that transitions from integer indices (representing specific words) to dense vectors. With the bulk of our parameters (13,226,800), this layer is responsible for fabricating a 200-dimensional vector for each word in our vocabulary. The 'None' in the output shape signifies this layer's capability to accept sequences of any length.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **LSTM Layers**<br>\n",
    ">Our architecture includes two LSTM layers with 128 units each. These layers are adept at managing sequential data, maintaining a memory of preceding inputs in the sequence. This feature is invaluable for sentiment analysis, where the sentence context is of crucial importance. Our initial LSTM layer is configured to return sequences, meaning it outputs a sequence identical in length to the input, enabling information passage to the next LSTM layer.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Dropout Layer**<br>\n",
    ">To curb overfitting, we've incorporated a dropout layer. This layer randomly assigns zero to a fraction (50% in our case) of input units at each update during training time, a step that aids in preventing overfitting.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Dense Layers**<br>\n",
    ">In conclusion, we have two dense layers. The first houses 64 units and utilizes the 'ReLU' activation function. To further deter overfitting, this layer also carries L1 and L2 regularization, applying penalties to the layer's output and weights respectively. These penalties deter overly complex or extreme values, encouraging more generalizable data patterns. Our final dense layer is the output layer, featuring 3 units corresponding to the three sentiment classes we're predicting ('Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive'). This layer leverages the 'softmax' activation function, delivering a probability distribution over the three classes.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Total Parameters**<br>\n",
    ">Altogether, our model possesses 13,535,283 parameters, all of which are trainable. The substantial quantity of parameters mainly originates from our embedding layer. Trainable parameters are those that the model assimilates from the training data, whereas non-trainable parameters remain static during training (our current model lacks any of these).\n",

    "We opted for the 'ReLU' (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function for the penultimate layer as it assists in addressing the vanishing gradient issue, a common phenomenon in deep neural networks. It's computationally efficient and performs reliably in numerous scenarios. For our output layer, we deployed the 'softmax' function, a standard choice for multiclass classification tasks, as it outputs a probability distribution over our target classes ('Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive').\n",

These figures are flexible, however, and may require adjustments depending on the task's performance.\n",

    ">- **Optimizer**<br>\n",
    "The 'adam' optimizer was chosen for its computational efficiency and modest memory demands. It's particularly suitable for problems involving substantial data and/or parameters. 'Adam' adjusts the learning rate for each weight individually, automating the tuning of the learning rate, which typically yields reliable results in practice.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Stopping criteria**<br>\n",
    "We have implemented early stopping, a regularization technique used to avoid overfitting when training a learner with an iterative method such as gradient descent. This method suspends the training process if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs. In our case, this was an essential criterion to ensure our model does not overfit the training data.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Evaluation metric**<br>\n",
    "'Accuracy' was chosen as our evaluation metric for its simplicity and widespread use in classification tasks. It calculates the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions. If our data is imbalanced, we might want to explore other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score, as these can provide a more comprehensive understanding of our model's performance across diverse classes.\n",

By setting a defined number of epochs, we may run the risk of overfitting if the model trains for too long and begins to capture noise and inconsistencies in the training set. Alternatively, we could underfit the model if the training duration is inadequate, thereby missing out on vital patterns in the data.\n",

The model was set to halt its training if it didn't register any improvement in the validation loss for a specific number of consecutive epochs. This approach makes the most of our training data by using it just as long as it is beneficial. Therefore, the model can autonomously decide when training ceases, ensuring an optimal balance between underfitting and overfitting. As seen from the final training epoch, early stopping efficiently halted the process once the validation loss ceased to improve.\n",

    ">The model, as a whole, demonstrates a good fit. It exhibits a gradual learning curve and manages to achieve a high accuracy on the training set. However, we noted signs of overfitting towards the end of the training process, where the validation loss started to increase, and validation accuracy plateaued. To counteract this, we implemented early stopping, which halted training once the model stopped improving on the validation set. Additionally, we incorporated dropout layers and L1 and L2 regularization within our model. These techniques randomly deactivate neurons and apply penalties to the model's weights, respectively, preventing the model from relying too much on any single pattern and encouraging it to find more generalizable underlying patterns.\n",

    ">Our neural network is structured to effectively handle the complex task of sentiment analysis on textual data. The architectural choices play an instrumental role in the model's efficacy, shaping how well it learns from our data, generalizes to unseen examples, and ultimately performs sentiment prediction. Starting off with the Embedding layer, this look-up table allows us to translate word indices into their corresponding vector representations. This layer is crucial as it enables our model to understand the semantic meaning embedded in each word and interpret how different words relate to one another. It's worth noting that the lion's share of our model's parameters resides in this layer due to its responsibility of crafting a 200-dimensional vector for each word in our vocabulary.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Moving on, the sequential nature of our textual data demanded the implementation of LSTM layers. With their ability to remember past inputs via internal memory, LSTM layers adeptly handle the dependencies between words in a sentence - an indispensable capability for sentiment analysis, as the sentiment often relies heavily on the context provided by the preceding words. The decision to use two LSTM layers augments the network's capacity to extract and interpret complex structures in the data. To mitigate overfitting, we strategically inserted a Dropout layer, which randomly sets a portion of its inputs to zero during each training step. This encourages the model to learn more robust, generalizable patterns in the data and lessens its tendency to over-rely on specific features.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The dense layers, or fully connected layers, act as the decision-making head of our network. The penultimate layer, with its 64 nodes, transforms the high-level features extracted by the preceding layers into a form suitable for final classification. By incorporating L1 and L2 regularization, we've ensured this layer doesn't produce overly complex or extreme values, further bolstering our model's generalizability. Our final layer houses three nodes corresponding to the three sentiment classes we're predicting. Utilizing the 'softmax' activation function, this layer effectively churns out a probability distribution over the classes, enabling us to identify the most probable sentiment for a given input review.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">As a whole, our network's architecture is designed to handle the intricate task of sentiment analysis with grace. It intelligently combines the ability to understand semantic meanings, remember crucial context, generalize well, and make informed decisions based on the learned patterns. Each architectural choice has a tangible impact on our model's performance and has been meticulously considered to ensure our model's success in sentiment prediction.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">- **Experimentation with Network Architecture:**<br>\n",
    ">Our current model demonstrates respectable performance, but there's always room for improvement. By varying the number of LSTM layers or their units, we could explore how these adjustments influence our model's accuracy. The addition of Bidirectional LSTMs, for instance, might enable the model to learn from both past and future context.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**<br>\n",
    ">Experimenting with the model's hyperparameters, such as batch size, learning rate, or the dropout rate, could result in improved model performance. Grid Search or Random Search methods could be employed to systematically identify the optimal combination of these hyperparameters.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Improved Handling of Imbalanced Classes:**<br>\n",
    ">Our model seemed to struggle slightly more with neutral reviews. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or generating synthetic samples could be explored to handle the class imbalance better, potentially enhancing the model's performance, particularly for underrepresented classes.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Enriched Preprocessing:**<br>\n",
    ">Investigating other text preprocessing techniques like more sophisticated tokenization, employing n-grams, or better handling of negations could lead to more effective feature extraction, subsequently boosting our model's ability to discern sentiments.\n",
    "><br><br>\n",
    ">- **Transfer Learning:**<br>\n",
    ">Leveraging pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe, or even more advanced language models like BERT, could enhance our model's understanding of semantic meanings, likely improving the sentiment prediction capabilities.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Through a combination of these tactics, we could refine our sentiment analysis model, ensuring it not only maintains its robust performance on the current dataset but also generalizes well to other similar tasks, bolstering its overall utility in real-world applications."
