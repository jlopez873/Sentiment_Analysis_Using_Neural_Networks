# Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks

This repository contains code, data, and a report detailing a sentiment analysis project carried out on Amazon product reviews using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

# Repository Contents
- **`Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains all the code used in this project, from data preprocessing and exploration, model architecture creation, training, and evaluation.

- **`Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks.html`**: This is an HTML version of the above Jupyter notebook for those who prefer to view it in a web browser.

- **`D213 - Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks.pdf`**: This comprehensive report provides an in-depth explanation of the project, including an overview of the methodology, data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and model evaluation.

- **`lstm_model.h5`**: This is the trained LSTM model saved in HDF5 file format. It's useful for those who wish to use the model for prediction without going through the training process.

- **`clean_reviews.json`**: This is a JSON file containing preprocessed review data ready for model training.

- **`review-West_Virginia_10.json`**: A sample JSON file containing 10 reviews from West Virginia used for model testing.
