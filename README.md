# Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks

This repository contains code, data, and a report detailing a sentiment analysis project carried out on Amazon product reviews using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

# Repository Contents
- **`Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains all the code used in this project, from data preprocessing and exploration, model architecture creation, training, and evaluation.

- **`Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks.html`**: This is an HTML version of the above Jupyter notebook for those who prefer to view it in a web browser.

- **`D213 - Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks.pdf`**: This comprehensive report provides an in-depth explanation of the project, including an overview of the methodology, data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and model evaluation.

*Due to the large size of NLP models and the amount of data required to train them, the files below are stored on Google Drive. Follow the title link to access each file.*

- **<a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/102xrsqe7fofDY6Otjryq-S3VzDUtaOaZ/view?usp=sharing'>`lstm_model.h5`</a>**: This is the trained LSTM model saved in HDF5 file format. It's useful for those who wish to use the model for prediction without going through the training process.

- **<a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/16rDRvKo8ZsN9sxT5dhNDQcAL1nWiwUYX/view?usp=sharing'>`clean_reviews.json`</a>**: This is a JSON file containing preprocessed review data ready for model training.

- **<a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w1VFDF7JvLg83RcPxE9Wj9NbKYPdKebP/view?usp=sharing'>`review-West_Virginia_10.json`</a>**: A sample JSON file containing 10 reviews from West Virginia used for model testing.
